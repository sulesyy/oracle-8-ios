Oracle-iOS-8 is a simple yet effective iOS application inspired by the classic Magic 8 Ball. When the user taps the button, a randomized answer image appears on the screen.  
I developed this project entirely on my own — from the coding to the design and visual-button matching.

This app was created as a way to practice and improve my skills in Swift programming and using the Xcode development environment.

Features

- Interactive interface using UIButton

-  Visual updates through UIImageView

- Manual layout of UI components via Storyboard

- Dynamic visual changes triggered by user input  

What I Learned

This project helped me understand the foundational concepts of iOS app development.

In Swift:

- Using `@IBOutlet` to connect UI elements to code

- Handling user interactions via `@IBAction`

- Displaying and changing images using `UIImageView`  

In Xcode & UI Design:

- Creating interfaces manually via Storyboard

- Placing and customizing UIButton and UIImageView elements
  
- Applying Auto Layout for a clean and responsive layout
  

In Git & GitHub:

- Initializing a local Git repository
  
- Managing and pushing my own code to GitHub
  
- Maintaining a clean commit history that reflects my personal contributions
  


Design & Visual Work

All interface elements — including the button and image placements — were selected, placed, and configured by me. No pre-made templates or boilerplate UI kits were used.  

Everything in the app:

- The button image
  
- The answer visuals
  
- The layout and color arrangement
 

was created and adjusted manually to fit the project’s concept.
